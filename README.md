This Repo contains several scripts for finance analysis and predictions.

If you adapt the tax numbers to your own hometown, you will be able to estimate your current tax load while seeing your progression step.
Further you could also estimate some investement trends, which are still very basic.

Currently, there is a budget analyser, which takes an excel sheet, containing serveral work-maps, collecting the same information and displaying them in a figure for visualization.
(This part will likely be depricated in the future and be exchanged by a web-server application. Currently working on that!)

Feel free to push and pull commits!
Cheers
